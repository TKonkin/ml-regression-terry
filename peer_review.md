Project review for Brett Vrtachnik

The README was included, and contained overview, link to notebook, Dataset info, models used, findings, and project setup.
Most readme I have observed have included the setup first, but this seems acceptable.

The notebook contained the Into, numbered sections and reflections.

The dataset is stored in the data folder.

A peer review is included.
